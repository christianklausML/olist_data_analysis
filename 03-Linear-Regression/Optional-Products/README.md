This challenge takes a similar approach as the `sellers` one, but applies it to `products`, grouped by `product_category`

ðŸ’¡ **There might be some `product_category` that significantly under-performs vs others, and that could be removed from the marketplace.**

To render the plotly-plots open the notebook `product.ipynb` in [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/christianklausML/olist_data_analysis/blob/master/03-Linear-Regression/Optional-Products/products.ipynb).
